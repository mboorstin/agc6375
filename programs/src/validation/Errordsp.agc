# Filename:	Errordsp.agc
# Purpose:	This is an error-display function for the validation
#		suite.
# Mod history:	07/04/04 RSB.	Began.
#		07/10/04 RSB.	Added display of the error sub-code.
#		07/17/04 RSB.	PRO key signal level inverted.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Display the error code.  What this does is to clear the entire display,
# except for MODE (which contains the error code), and then lights the
# OPR ERR lamp and waits for the ENTR key to be hit.  Then it unlights
# OPR ERR and continues.
