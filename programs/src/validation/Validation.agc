# Filename:	Validation.agc
# Purpose:	This is a program which attempts to provide a validation
#		suite --- "suite" being, perhaps, too grandiose a term ---
#		for the instructions of the yaAGC CPU.  I've written this
#		directly from E-2052 (Savage & Drake).
# Mod history:	07/03/04 RSB.	Began.
#		07/07/04 RSB.	Added ValidateSmally.agc.
#		07/10/04 RSB.	Added ERRSUB.
#		07/23/04 RSB	Added a few seconds of delay at the start
#				of the program.
#		08/12/04 RSB	... and removed it again, since yaAGC has
#				been fixed not to need it.  The last time
#				I checked, Julian's sim would still need\
#				it, but that was a month or so ago.

# This program is probably not a bad introduction on how to write an AGC
# program that interacts with the DSKY, though it doesn't use any interrupts.
# What it does is pretty simple:
#
#	1.  Clears the DSKY, and then writes 00 to MODE of the DSKY.
#	2.  Perform tests.  Upon finding an error:
#	    a)	Writes a non-zero error code to MODE of the DSKY.
#	    b)  Turns on the OPR ERR lamp.
#	    c)  Waits for the PRO key to be pressed.
#	    d)	Turns off the OPR ERR lamp.
#	    e)	Proceeds with further tests.
#	3.  When all done, writes 77 to MODE of the DSKY.
#
# To keep this file from becoming too big and ponderous, most of the
# code is split out into include-files.
