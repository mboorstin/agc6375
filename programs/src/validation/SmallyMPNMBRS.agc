# Filename:	SmallyMPNMBRS.agc
# Purpose:	This is code written from the flowchart on p. 58-61 of
#		E-2065, which is a document titled "Block II AGC
#		Self-Check and Show-Banksum", by Edwin D. Smally.
# Mod history:	07/07/04 RSB.	Began.
#
# Similar code was apparently originally in Luminary and/or Colossus,
# but much of it was removed over the course of time to make more room.  
# I don't know what the original code was like, but the flowcharts still
# exist, so I've rewritten the code from the flowcharts. 

		# P. 58 of Smally.
