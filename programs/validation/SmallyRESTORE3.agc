# Filename:	SmallyRESTORE3.agc
# Purpose:	This is code written from the flowchart on p. 37 of
#		E-2065, which is a document titled "Block II AGC
#		Self-Check and Show-Banksum", by Edwin D. Smally.
# Mod history:	07/07/04 RSB.	Began.
#
# Similar code was apparently originally in Luminary and/or Colossus,
# but much of it was removed over the course of time to make more room.  
# I don't know what the original code was like, but the flowcharts still
# exist, so I've rewritten the code from the flowcharts. 

		# P. 37 of Smally.  It APPEARS to me that various 
		# statements about the contents of A are wrong here,
		# probably because of the OCR'ing which has been done
		# on Smally's doc before posting to the internet.
